This plugin provides one wrapper command for the glark command:

    :Glark <args>

Example: Find occurrences of "foo" and "bar" within 3 lines and 
display 2 lines context:

    :Glark -r -C 2 --and=3 foo bar *

The arguments are passed to the glark command.

It displays the output of the glark command (see below) in a window, 
does some highlighting and provides some handy key maps.

If you don't want to display context information, you're probably better
off by setting 'grepprg' to "glark --grep".

Be also aware that this plugin doesn't use vim's quickfix functionality
as most grep plugins do.
